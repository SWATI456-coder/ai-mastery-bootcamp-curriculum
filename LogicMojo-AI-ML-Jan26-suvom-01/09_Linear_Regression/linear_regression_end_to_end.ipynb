    "Before we build anything, we need the right tools. In Python, we don't write everything from scratch—we import libraries created by smart people around the world!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧑‍🏫 Modules :\n",
    "*   `numpy` (Numerical Python): Think of this as a super-powered calculator. It handles complex math and large grids of numbers (arrays/matrices) extremely fast.\n",
    "*   `pandas`: This is basically Excel on steroids. It lets us load data, manipulate columns/rows, and view it nicely in a table (DataFrame).\n",
    "*   `matplotlib.pyplot`: This is our paintbrush. We use it to draw charts and graphs so we can *see* our data and errors visually.\n",
    "*   `sklearn` (Scikit-Learn): The ultimate Machine Learning toolbox! It contains everything we need:\n",
    "    *   `load_diabetes`: A built-in dataset we can use instantly.\n",
    "    *   `train_test_split`: A tool to randomly chop our data into \"study\" and \"exam\" sets.\n",
    "    *   `mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score`: Our \"grading tools\" to see how well the model performed.\n",
    "    *   `LinearRegression`: The actual ML algorithm we will train.\n",
    "    *   `RidgeCV, LassoCV`: Advanced forms of linear regression to stop the model from memorizing too much (Regularization).\n",
    "    *   `StandardScaler`: A tool to make sure all numerical features are on the same \"scale\" (e.g., converting heights in cm and weights in kg into a standardized format).\n"
